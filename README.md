# TypeScript 2.x for Angular Developers
This is the code repository for [TypeScript 2.x for Angular Developers](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/typescript-angular-developers?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786460554), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, is the default language for building Angular applications from Google. TypeScript 2.0 adds optional static types, classes, and modules to JavaScript, to enable great tooling and better structuring of large JavaScript applications.

This book will teach you how to leverage the exciting features of TypeScript while working on Angular projects to build scalable, data-intensive web applications. You will begin by setting up and installing TypeScript and then compile it with JavaScript. You will then learn to write simple JavaScript expressions with TypeScript. You will then go through some built in TypeScript types and accessors. Further you will build web components using TypeScript Interfaces and Decorators. You will go through the Angular form module, which will enable you to write predictable typed forms with TypeScript and learn to use typed DOM events. You will also build a single-page application using the Router module. Lastly, you will consume API data with Angular's HTTP Module and handle responses with RxJS observables. At the end of the book, you will go through different testing and debugging techniques.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

1) Clone the repository
2) cd into each example fordler. Eg:

    ```cd Chapter11/http-todo```

3) Install dependencies

    ```npm install```

4) Install Angular CLI

    ```npm install -g angular-cli```

5) Start App

    ```ng serve```

The code will look like the following:
```
<html>
 <head>
   <title>Example 2.1: Hello World</title>
   <!-- Include Bootstrap and custom style -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="2.1.css">
 </head>
 <body>
   <div class="container">
     <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-4 main">
       <h3 class="messenger"></h3>
     </div>
     <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-4 main">
       <input type="text" class="form-control">
       <button class="button">Greet</button>
     </div>
   </div>
   <!-- Include JavaScript file -->
   <script src="2.1.js"></script>
 </body>
</html>
```

The examples covered in this book can be implemented on a Windows, Linux, or macOS PC. You'll need to install Node and npm to work with TypeScript, and a decent web browser.
